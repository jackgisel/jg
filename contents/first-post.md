# Hey world!

Thanks for reading my first blog post. This is going to be a short description about where I am at in life and how I built this blog! I hope you enjoy :)

## What is going on?

Currently I am wrapping up my senior year at San Jose State University studying Software Engineering. I will be remote for the remainder of my school which I am not overally upset about. I would rather be 100% online vs in person with some restrictions and fears of possibly going back online. Seems stressful. Because of this being completly online it has sparked some interest of mine for traveling. So I might be doing a solo adventure somewhere shortly. Other than that I am working on getting a full time offer for when I graduate.

## How did I make this website?

I built this website using NextJS which is a React framework (lol) that allows you to create SSG, SSR, etc from React. It is extemely simple and powerful. I much prefer it to Gatsby only because when I create a new project I like to know what ever file does. Gatsby comes with so much boiler plate. Next is as simple as installing a package and making 2 files/folders! Pretty great. The content for this site is just being server from static markdown files. I started using markdown for most of my note taking so it feels nice to just stay in my text editor to type out these blogs!

Well I am just going to keep this short since this is my first blog post. In my next couple posts I am going to be discussing how serverless architecture allowed me to build a social network that is extermely inexpensive.
